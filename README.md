A small and simple code to plot a periodic but randomized central tendency of
a data source. 
Started out as an independent project to measure 'deterministic choas' with a randomized variable.
But now looks like a specific version of Random Walks, not sure
Original Inspiration - Starting point to computing a large number of particles, being affected by each other, such as gas particles in a box.
Early codes use randomint() to randomize the data source.
Used simple quantum mechanical principles (qiskit module - Aer simulator) to replace random().
Second possible study emerging: Measuring any difference between the data source plotted using Quantum Computing (Qiskit) and the pseudo-RNG of python (random)
Graph not yet plotted. Will be done soon.
Only the Data Source initialized
